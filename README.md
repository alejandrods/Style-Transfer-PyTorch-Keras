# Style_Transfer Pytorch and Keras

Full article in [Medium](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/style-transfer-pytorch-84cf2e9ba86d)

I have recreated the style transfer method of this project: [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf). The features found in the VGG19 Network are used to transfer the style between pictures. Project developed using PyTorch as well as Keras.

I have used my dog, called Rosc√≥n, as a model for this experiment! He was rewarded with a treat.
